```GENERAL DICTATOR'S LICENSE v2.1
18.04.2021 DD.MM.YYYY Gregorian Calendar

1: PREAMBLE
The GENERAL DICTATOR'S LICENSE tries to reduce frauds and 
cash-ins, while permitting free use of any component that
was released for free from an official source at the given time.
The author retains complete control of the software, and is to
be seen as a "benevolent god".


2: DISCLAIMER
Authors of any component are not liable in any way, shape, or form
for damages and/or inconveniences caused by this program, whether
it be through misuse on the user's part, programming errors,
ill intent, or a plain lack of common sense.
This non-liability extends to everything, including computer systems,
IPs, and people's physical and psychological well-being.
The software is provided "AS IS".
All warranties are disclaimed by any contributing authors and modders.


3: NC-FAIR-USE
Without a permission from the author, third parties may only host the
software for noncommercial use. Private sharing is allowed for noncommercial use.
Hosting the software for setup purposes, e. g. drivers, counts as noncommercial use.
If the software in question is a game engine, commercial use is generally allowed,
and counts as a bundle. A non-bundled version must still be provided, unless the
author gave permission.

Permissions for certain actions may be issued by the author, and
can be revoked at any given moment for any-or-no reason, and either
action is in effect immediately it has been issued.

Actions that are prohibited without permission include, but are not
limited to:
(a) Bundling the software or a fork of it with other software and/or
    hardware, without providing an unbundled version.
    Hardware includes all physical goods.
(b) Demanding a fee to download and/or run the software or a fork of it.
(c) Commercializing components explicitly designed to work with this
    software or a fork of it, if no other compatible programs exist.
(d) Misleading customers with screenshots of this software or a fork of
    it, if the advertisement is for a third party software or hardware.
(e) Using the included graphics, sounds, and any other assets for any other 
    purpose than this software, a fork of it, mods, videos, screenshots,
    comics, and other media.
    
    
4: MODIFICATIONS
(a) General
    Public modifications to the source code are allowed ONLY if they are 
    built on files that were released for free from an official channel 
    at the given time. Hidden URLs don't count as official channels.
    You are not allowed to modify or remove any logos or copyright notices.
    Everything created from this software's codebase has to be released
    under the same license as the original program, with the author of
    the original program being granted exclusive rights.
    Source files must be provided.
(b) Fixes and improvements
    All fixes and improvements to any files have to be returned to the 
    author for evaluation, and may be included into the project without
    further notice and/or compensation.
    If a fix is made on a fork, the improvement should also be provided
    to the person who forked it.
(c) Forks
    Forks are encouraged. (a) and (b) still apply.
    They may not be presented as the original software.
    Ports and remakes count as forks.
(d) Additional content, "mods", and plugins (if supported)
    Newly created components are an exception to these rules, and do not 
    have to be presented, although it would be appreciated.
    All terms of 3 still apply to them.
(e) Ports
    Ports to other languages or platforms are allowed, and are counted as forks.
    Improvements that are non applicable to the original language or platform
    do NOT have to be returned (e.g. language specific code optimizations). 
    (a) and (b) apply otherwise.
    Ports to other operating systems count as both code modifications and 
    forks, thus (a) and (b) apply.
(f) Remakes (only if explicitly stated as such)
    If they are found to be infringing on the respective IP while disregarding
    the terms of this license, legal action will be taken.
    Remakes are otherwise treated like ports.
(g) Reverse engineering
    The practice of disassembling a program to see how it works is commonly 
    used by enthusiasts to further the development of their own projects,
    and as such is highly encouraged by this license.
    Reverse engineering is special in the regard, that it is exempt from all
    terms except (b).
(h) DRM circumvention
    "Cracks", as copy-protection-removing alterations of code are often called,
    are permitted, as are keygens, as long as no regular user is negatively impacted
    by their presence. 
    Circumventing server authorization ("always-online", or an online serial number check)
    is permitted via a man-in-the-middle server emulation, or code isolation.
    Server emulation in general is permitted, (b) still applies, as does all of 3.
    Cracks are seen as a case of (g), and any security flaw detected by crackers
    must be reported to the authors as mentioned under (b).
    
    
5: CREATED CONTENT
All content that is newly created by you with this software is your 
personal IP and is not hindered by any of the licensing terms mentioned,
except if said content is built on existing assets or code.
You are still liable under local law.


6: PERPETUITY
Newer versions of this license will automatically replace older versions
which have this note, starting with DICTATOR'S LICENSE 14.12.15.
The GENERAL DICTATOR'S LICENSE is an enhanced version, and will replace
the DICTATOR'S LICENSE, beginning with date 20.01.16.
This form of an auto-updating license does not extend to major revisions;
E. g. v3.2 will replace v3.1, while v4.0 will not replace v3.2.
After .9, alphanumeric characters will extend the minor revision number;
E. g. v1.9 will be replaced by v1.9a, then 1.9b, etc.

8: LOSS OF RIGHTS

software without transferring the rights to another party, the software
will change its licensing to CC-BY, with the extension of mentioning all
previous authors by name if possible, and requiring available source files
to be provided.
Commercial products by the original author are also affected by this, and 
DRM circumvention may not be prosecuted after a loss of rights has occured.
A loss of rights can also be manually initiated by the author.


9: DONATIONS
Donations, if non-intrusive (here: not included in the program or presented
as a nag-screen on a website) are allowed.
Mandatory donations, or ones with added bonuses against non-paying users are 
prohibited by default.
